/**
 * @param seed The seed value to use, such as that returned by `mnemonic.toSeed()`. If a bigint is supplied, it is converted to a 64-byte array (big endian, left padded with 0)
 * @param derivationPath The BIP 32 derivation path to use when deriving the key from the seed.  If not supplied then `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0` is used.
 * @returns A 64-bit private key valid for usage in secp256k1.
